					head straight to Blue Lagoon before you head into the city.If you
					do not have a car then you can book any of the guide tours that
					pre-books your slot and has pick from the airport and also dropping
					you at your destination.Enquire with any of the service providers
					online.</p>

					wasting your time.Your itinerary can be spared for destinations due
					to the travel time to this place from the Capital.</p>
				<p>It is a man made extravaganza present enroute between
					Keflavik airport to Reykjavik.The heat is primarily uses the
					volcanic landscape near by to keep the water warm all the time.It
					is basically a geo thermal plant.</p>
