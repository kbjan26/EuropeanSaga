			<h4>How to do day trips from Reykjavik ?</h4>
			<p>
				Fortunately, I had 6 days to spend in Iceland and all my trips were
				guided trips.There are several agencies who does group trips,guided
				trips,private guide tours.I chose <a href="grayline.is/"
					target="_blank">www.grayline.is/</a> since their pricing scale
				fitted my budget. My base was in the captial,Reykjavik.All the spots
				are very far away from Reykjavik and it almost takes 12 to 14 hours
				to cover and come back.The public transportation is almost none to
				support in this cause unless or until you are planning for a road
				trip.

			<h4>Where to stay in the Reykjavik ?</h4>
			<p>There are several hostels and hotels available inside the
				city. I chose KEX hostel and it is probably the best hostel I have
				ever stayed so far with an in-house bar.You can find more about my
				experience at KEX in the below link</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<p>This natural phenomena is a traveller's dream and I must say I
				have been fortuntate enough to witness this marvel.</p>
			<p>If you are in Iceland please ensure you include this in your
				first day of your Itinerary.</p>
			<p>The chances are high that if you are unfortunate that you will
				never see Northern Lights at all.</p>
			<p>If you are doing with guide agency like grayline , the ticket
				is valid for one year and they take you continously until they have
				succeeded.</p>
			<p>The weather out there is extremely cold and you cannot think
				of playing around with your camera to capture photos.</p>
			<p>If you are crazy on photos check out various tutorials online
				as to how to use your camera for capturing the lady aurora.</p>
			<p>Carry a tripod to capture it using your camera.</p>
