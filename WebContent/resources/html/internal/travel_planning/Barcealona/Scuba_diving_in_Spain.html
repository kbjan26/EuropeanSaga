				<p>Scuba diving was on top of my checklist due to the Indian
					movie Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara and for the fact that I recently
					accomplished learning swimming.</p>
				<p>I did it at a place called Zindagi L'estartit, a costal place
					of Costa Brava and involves a day trip from Barcealona. The school
					provides you with basic gear set and training before you jump into
					the water.</p>
				<h3>
					<b>What does the day trip involve from Barcealona?</b>
				</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Round trip in train from Barcelona Sants to Girona.It
						takes 30 mins and approximately 28 Euros.</li>
					<li>You can book the tickets through go euro website</li>
					<li><a href="www.goeuro.com" target="_blank">www.goeuro.com</a>
					<li>Bus travel from Girona to l'estartit by AMPSA bus service
						provider.It takes exactly one hour.</li>
					<li>Scuba diving will cost you anywhere between 65 to 70 Euros
						including photos depending on the school.</li>
					<li>Prior appointment with the driving schools.If your arrival
						is not confirmed then they will not reserver your slot.</li>
					<li>Carry a towel along with you to dry yourself once you are
						done.</li>
					<li>Some crazy mind with high adrenaline rush.</li>
				</ol>
				<h3>
					<b>What you should know?</b>
				</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Book appropriate train depending on your reservation.</li>
					<li>Bus timings of AMPSA service provider are only once every
						hour.</li>

						for weekdays if you are travelling from Barcealona.</li>
