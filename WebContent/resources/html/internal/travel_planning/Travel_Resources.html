				<p>Resources are plenty and all it requires is narrowing down on
					proper ones to make the most.Out of all searched online I am yet to
					find that equals TripAdvisor.</p>
				<p>Porbably the best site that gives you complete insight of a
					place and ground reality.I post as much as possible seeking answers
					from people who live there and who have been there.It gives you an
					excellent vision and better forecast about the place.You get to
					know the best and cheap ways of travelling when you are there.What
					to do,What not to do and What not to miss.</p>
				<p>I always stay in hostels and check out their ratings from
					Booking.com or Hostelworld.com.The former always gives me a decent
					price coming with free cancellation policy.</p>
				<a href="www.tripadvisor.com" target="_blank">TripAdvisor.com</a>
				<p>Probably the biggest community online to get information
					about places and events.Make the most when you plan your travel.</p>
				<a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com" target="_blank">LonelyPlanet.com</a>
				<p>Another amazing site with plethora of resources to look out
					from to plan better.</p>
				<a href="www.airbnb.com" target="_blank">Airbnb.com</a>
				<p>When there are no hostels in the locality I am destined to ,
					then my immediate choice is Airbnb.Safest genuine accomodation
					sites to book.</p>
				<a href="www.booking.com" target="_blank">Booking.com</a>
				<p>The best site which gives me accomodation coming along with
					free cancellation policies.It also has ratings and reviews from
					fellow travellers that helps you to choose the best of the lot.</p>
				<a href="https://www.hostelworld.com/" target="_blank">HostelWorld.com</a>
				<p>The best site for budget travellers who are on the look out
					for dormitory beds to choose from the best ones.It again comes with
					reviews and ratings.</p>
				<a href="www.easyjet.com" target="_blank">EasyJet.com</a>
				<p>My default choice when I travel from Berlin SXF airport.One
					of the low cost carriers which flies to all possible exotic
					destinations.</p>
				<a href="www.ryanair.com" target="_blank">Ryanair.com</a>
				<p>If you are in Europe, then its an obvious choice to fly at
					low cost.</p>
				<a href="https://www.polskibus.com/pl/index.htm" target="_blank">Polskibus.com</a>
				<p>This page requires a special mention for the best of the
					service it provides from Poland.Every time I fly from Berlin , I
					take a bus from Wroclaw to Berlin at a very cheap price and even if
					you do a last minute booking the price remains the same.</p>
				<a href="https://www.goeuro.com/trains/?dw=true" target="_blank">GoEuro.com</a>
				<p>One of the best sites to book for trains to travel between
					cities.I use it most of the times to book my train journeys.Ensure
					you plan it well in advance to get a discounted price.</p>
