				<p>The insane journey that I have taken all alone on a foreign
					land has given me some of the wonderful memories so far.Meeting new
					persons ,making acquaintance has been the best aspect so far.You
					come out of your shell and you have the opportunity to go beyond
					your boundaries.Aspect of socializing has helped me to mingle with
					anyone instantly.Shyness is a long gone trait in me.</p>
				<p>Hostel culture has shaped me to become more adaptive for any
					sort of circumstance.Few hours of pub talk on a solo travel has
					always been fun ranging from exchanging the cultural values to
					learning to be more independent in life from other's personal
					experience.</p>
				<p>Some of the best remembrances from the wonderful journey are
					below.</p>

						match the same day.After boarding the bus realised I did not have
						hard cash to pay since they do not accept cash.If I had to get
						down the next bus was at 5 PM and I was on the verge of spoiling
						the rest of the day's itinerary.Fortunately to my rescue the
						gentleman named David from UK in the bus came forward unasked and
						paid for my travel.It was such a noble gesture and I returned him
						the money upon reaching Girona station.</figcaption>
