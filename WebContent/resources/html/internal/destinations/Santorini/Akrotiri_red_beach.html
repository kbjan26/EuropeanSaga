				<p>After roaming around Oia and spectating easter celebrations
					at Pyrgos , the second day was allocated for Akrotiri,red beach and
					the sunset at Oia that was missed on the first day.</p>
				<p>Akrotiri , I was told to have ancient excavations remains
					dating back to thousand of years old.The excavations at Akrotiri
					have uncovered one of the most important prehistoric settlements of
					the Aegean.Its quite far from Fira town but since I had a bike it
					did not seem that difficult reaching the spot.In the dedicated
					parking lot you will be charged to park your vehicle and the
					entrance by itself costs 15 euros.I had so much of expectations to
					see what was in stake.</p>
				<p>The place has well preserved remains by archealogists who
					have done extensive research in unearthing this place.The entire
					place is covered under the roof and you are not supposed to go near
					most of the ruins.It was highly disappointing that they had only
					few very remains for the display for an hefty charge at the
					entrance.</p>
				<p>On the flip side , red beach located just few hundred metres
					is one of the best hunted spots in Santorini.The mountains resemble
					red color due to the high volcanic activity remains from the
					past.People here ask us to refrain from swimming due to frequent
					rock falls.However , you will miss an enthralled experience if you
					do not take the risk.</p>

				<p>Most of the people who come here swim in the less rough tides
					and hence you will not be afraid of.I chose to get into the water
					and was so thankful that my belongings were taken care of by a
					Spanish couple who were taking sun bath.I was in the water for
					almost one and half hours.It was such a soothing and relaxing
					atmosphere to relish.</p>
