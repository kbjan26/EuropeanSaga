				<p>Moments has it own twists,turns and surprises.It was how I
					did cliff jumping at Amoudi Bay Santorini.</p>
				<p>I did some homework before my Santorini trip in Internet
					which gave me information about Amoudi Bay, sea shore in Santorini
					reachable if you head down further from Oia.The place is famous for
					scenic spots, donkey ride,sea food,cliff jumping.I was so excited
					and fascinated about this place but never even in my thoughts I
					realised I could jump off a cliff and have the best experience of
					my lifetime.</p>

				<p>I started off to this place around 10 A.M from Fira and I
					intended to cover Imerovigli as well on the same day.I reached this
					place easily since I had a bike.I was taking pictures in a crazy
					manner since I was able to capture some of the beautiful views.That
					was the very morning my mom advised me not to do anything stupid
					when I told I am heading to a place which is quite crazy.</p>
				<p>After capturing enough , I headed to the other side of the
					bay which was more secluded and more of shore.I saw two couples
					relaxing and there was none other.Since there were no rough tides ,
					I decided to take a dip and swim across for few mins before heading
					back.Also , I requested one of the person to capture myself when I
					am in waters just to boast that I did swim :).And the lady (Kate
					Jones from UK) captured and shared all the photos via email.</p>

				<p>After having experienced enough ,I came to the shore and was
					drying myself to head back.I thanked the lady who took the picture
					and was about to head back when I saw a gril heading towards me
					with a welcome smile.</p>
				<p>The girl : Hello, how are you</p>
				<p>Me : fine , thanks.</p>
				<p>The girl : How was the swim ? And did you manage to jump from
					the cliffs?.</p>
				<p>Me : No , I just swam for few mins.I am all alone travelling
					and did not want to take the risk.I have not done such things
					before.I came to know her name was Meghan Hargaden after we did the
					jump.</p>
				<p>Meghan:Come lets jump from the cliffs.</p>
				<p>I was completely taken aback and was so excited on this.Never
					on Earth I thought would be doing this.Moments has its own twists
					and turns in deed.</p>
				<p>After a brief conversation , I met her mother and big mother
					( I assume) who have come all the way from America and also two
					others girls from Montreal who joined us.They were so excited on my
					solo travelling and felt very happy.We were fortunate that we could
					take turns on this and capture it in my DSLR ( the best part of
					all).</p>
				<p>It was few mins swim to the cliff and we went up and I was
					breathing quite heavily.I requested Meghan to go it first so that I
					could see how to and where to jumo.She did it at ease.Oh
					mannn!!!.After quite some thoughts , did a blind jump which was
					successful.However,there was quite a pain and finally came to know
					it was a wrong jump(actually a belly flop.)</p>

				<p>But I did not give up yet and requested for another jump to

					it was a perfect one!!Yaayyy I did it.</p>
