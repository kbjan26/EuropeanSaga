				<p>After the bomb threat scene and delayed flight from Warsaw
					reached Athens around 2 A.M in the morning.I was supposed to take a
					ferry from Pireaus Port to Santorini and it was around 7 A.M in the
					morning. After much hassle reached one of the most exotic
					destinations in the world,Santorini.</p>
				<p>The view from the port to Fira town is so captivating that
					you already get a feel of what is in stock.Directly headed to my
					accomodation to get refreshed to visit the tiny wonder ,heaven on
					Earth , Oia.</p>
				<p>I hired a bike to travel across Santorini during my entire
					stay.I directly headed to Oia town around 2.30 P.M.You fall in love
					at the first place when you see the hill town from the entrance.You
					are just left with awe struck feeling to see such a stunning place
					on Earth.All the houses are built on top of mountain rocks and the
					view from them must be really amazing.</p>

				<p>As soon as you enter the town ,you see many Asian couples
					thronging the place to take wedding shots captured.You just keep
					walking and walking across the corners to see which view is better
					but you will eventually find it hard to appreciate since every view
					will have aesthetic appeal.On my first visit , there was no sunset
					happening because of the climate and this gave me more space and
					time to roam around the town.I could even hike down the hills.The
					beauty of this place is highly elevated on the eve of the sunset.</p>
