				<p>Pyrgos town is one of the best picturesque villages in
					Santorini.Located by few kilometres away ,the place is highly
					famous for its easter celebrations.It was included in my itinerary
					during my research around easter celebrations that are special in
					this island.I discovered the exact details of this event upon my
					return from Barcealona at Berlin SXF airport.The entire village is
					set ablaze from every roof top .every church,every path and
					supposed to be spectacular to view.I came to know that it is
					celebrated on Easter Friday.To my dismay , I had prebooked my
					flight from Athens to Santorini on Saturday morning.</p>
				<p>My schedule went for toss after having realised that I had to
					be there to witness this spectacular event.I had to forego my
					flight costs and booked a speedboat from Athens to Santorini on the
					same day I land in Athens so that I would not miss this.Without any
					second thoughts I booked a boat service.</p>
				<p>The entire people of the village gather on the eve of Easter
					on Friday around 9 PM gather at the main church to start the march
					or parade around the village.Religious prayers are uttered and
					candles are lit up before the start.Gradually the momentum
					increases and youngsters from the village start lighting up tiny
					candle like thing.As and when the march progresses , you see people
					gathered at various spots lit up making the view truly spectacular
					and the event lasts for couple of hours.The magical event is not to
					be missed when you are in Santorini.</p>
