				<p>The hiking trail activity was one of the best I did when I
					was in Santorini and a must do when you have sufficient time.The
					overall journey takes less than three hours provided you do not
					take too much pit stops for photos and give you some of the
					spectacular view of this hilly region that will leave you spell
					bounded.</p>
				<p>I did this on a cloudy morning and was discouraged by many
					locals to refrain from doing owing to less fellow mates who would
					be taking it.But less sun shine indeed helps you to achieve the
					hike easily.Against all odds , with Umbrella ,headset,few snacks
					and a Water Bottle started my hike after parking my bike near Fira
					bus station.</p>

				<p>The trail has main transit through Imerovigli and its the
					first pit stop that you will be taking during your hike.The entire
					trail is not paved though designated paths are there enroute which
					are smooth enough.Most of the inland route is through the villages
					located between Fira and Oia.The views are breath taking that you
					will not use see if you travel on road from Fria to Oia.</p>

				<p>The entire trail path is signed and I did not find any
					difficulty in covering the route. Moving further , you would pass
					by Church of Agios Antonios (Saint Antony) and the Church of
					Prophet Elias</p>

				<p>Now that you have almost reached Oia , you will start seeing
					the glimpse of this earthly beauty located just few KMs away.The
					entire walk was so refreshing and to my surprise it happened to be
					the St.George day ( falls during holy week of Easter). They were
					serving bread,potatoes,meat ,wine at the starting point of the town
					to everyone.</p>
