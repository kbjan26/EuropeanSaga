				<p>After having extraordinary day one in Iceland , the second
					day was allocated for golden circle waterfalls and Strokkur geysir.</p>
				<p>Its located almost 300 kms from Reykjavik.I was picked up
					around 8.45 AM from hostel.All guided tours includes hostel pick up
					and drop.We headed for the spot at 9.30 AM from the tourist
					office.The cost of the trip was close to 85 euros.</p>
				<p>Our first stop was at golden circle waterfalls.It was the
					start of the spring and end of winter and hence had an amazing view
					of the water flowing down through the ice.The guide who accompanied
					us briefed us about the waterfalls and the ancient parliament
					located near to it.The landscapes enroute to this place was the
					best of all I captured during my entire stay.It was a sheer scenic
					beauty to witness.</p>
				<p>After a long walk around the falls , we had additional time
					to have our lunch.Iceland was my first solo travelling destination
					and had very little time to plan.Bought tomato soup and a burger in
					the hotel and it costed me 30 euros for single meal.Iceland is one
					of the costly destinations that I have ever been.Thats where I
					decided to start cooking myself from next day to save some money.</p>

				<p>The next journey was headed to Strokkur geyser.We were
					breifed about high temperatures and water eruptions in that area
					due to high volanic activities in the past.I did not believe until
					I saw what descibed was true.The water here erupts almost 30 meters
					for every 5 to 6 mins throughout the year.I captured both the video
					and pictures of this unique natual happening.The day was over then
					after which we returned back to the captial.One long tiring day was
					over and never realised all my day trips from the city would be the
					same.</p>
