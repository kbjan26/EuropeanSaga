				<p>Iceland is one of the costliest European destinations that I
					have ever been.My first day lunch was 30 euros which was an eye
					opener to start cooking during the trips.If possible carry whatever
					you can before you land there.I carried some snacks which lasted
					for two days.Below are the points which any budget traveller might
					find highly useful.</p>
				<p>If you like hostel culture ,try KEX hostel which has
					excellent facilities in store.</p>
				<p>Take a container along with you to pack foods for your
					travel.</p>
				<p>BONUS is the cheapest super market located in the
					city.However, please be aware of the wierd opening timings it has.</p>
				<p>Grayline tour operator is the cheapest I could find of all
					operating agenices.</p>
				<p>WOW air the cheap airliner that commutes from various
					destinations.</p>
				<p>If you are in groups, then you may hire a car avoiding costly
					day trips.</p>
