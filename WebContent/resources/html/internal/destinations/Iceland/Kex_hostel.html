				<p>KEX was my first exposure to European hostel culture and I
					had no clue what it would look like.I had all butterfly thoughts as
					to how I will accomodate and adapt to the hostel environment.To my
					amazement , the experience was stupendous.I chose this place upon
					the recommendation of another friend.</p>
				<p>Never new the greeting would be so warmer.Every turn you take
					you have an unknown face welcoming you.I had reserved for a 16 bed
					dormitory.The hostel has a inhouse bar serving drinks till 2 AM in
					the morning.The breakfast comes at a very cheap cost with tummy
					full of foods.The hostel is located just opposite to the harbor
					lake and gives you an aesthetic aerial view.</p>
				<p>This was the place where I started cooking to save some
					money.The hostel facilities were outstanding where in one of the
					nights I had severe leg sprain which I aggravated from fall at
					Strokkur geysir spot that I had to disturb the receptionist at 2 AM
					in the morning.He was kind enough to get me a big ice bag to apply
					over the spot.</p>
				<p>This was the place where I met fellow solo travellers from
					whom I shared and gained valuable experiences.</p>
