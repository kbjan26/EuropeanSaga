				<p>The hike activity was one of the most awaited events in my
					entire itinerary.This glacier is one of the largest in Iceland and
					is called Home of Sun ( which I remember by heart because the guide
					questioned me several times and ensure its remembered for
					ever).Again , the travel to this route is via Skogafoss waterfall
					and is very far away from the captial.I reserved the slot online
					through gray line web site.I had also rented hiking boots,rain coat
					suiting my size.</p>

				<p>Our guide was a danish and was an experienced lad.We were
					split into groups of ten.We were briefed about the do and dont's
					before even we could start on the history of the place.They take
					minute care of every single tourist since a slip could cause severe
					damages.</p>
				<p>The hike itself lasted almost two hours with pit stops at
					several spots where the guide described of its significance.Finaly
					we reached the top where we could drink pure water melted from
					Ice.At the top , we could also see a measurement device to check
					the height of the ice and the receding measurement.It was alarming
					to know that there is a significant descent in the measurement due
					to climatic changes.The melting ice flows into the ocean is what we
					were told.</p>

					<p>It's better to take your own rain coat and hiking
						boots.However , it's a must either to ensure you do not get wet
						enroute.</p>
					<p>Follow the guide rules strictly to avoid any stupidity and
						from being hurt yourself.</p>
