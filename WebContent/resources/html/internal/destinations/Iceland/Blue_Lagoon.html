				<p>Landed in Keflavik around 14.10 PM and headed to this place
					right away since its enroute to Rejyavik.I had booked all my trips
					with a tour company called gray lined.I had scheduled this visit
					for 15.30 prior to my landing and the bus was ready waiting
					outside.I was the only passenger in the bus and yet they did take
					me to the spot with any hassle.</p>
				<p>This place is artifically constructed with high land scape
					surroundings and one of the busiest with each and every tourist
					visiting before heading to the city.</p>

				<p>It has a big pool with water kept at moderate temperatues all
					the time.It has rich mineral supplies on the shores that can be
					applied before we immerse ourselves inside the water.There is a
					tiny waterfall and sauna room beside that.</p>
				<p>You get some of the best captures if you have the camera
					carried all along during your swim.</p>

					<p>Ensure you visit this place before you head to the city
						since its enroute.Avoid making half day trip from Reykjavik.</p>
					<p>You don't more than 3 hours at this place.</p>
					<p>Take your own towel to save 5 euros.</p>
					<p>Buy waterproof case for camera/phone in order to capture
						yourselves when you are inside the water which I missed and
						realised during my swim around the pool.</p>
