				<p>The most excited destination of all the trips was
					experiencing northern lights.I heard so much from my friend who had
					experienced this at Norway.</p>
				<p>I ensured I do this on the day I land in Iceland since the
					possibility of missing it was high due to climatic conditions.The
					tour organisers had promised for rescheduling it again if we failed
					to witness this wonder.Usually go ahead for this tour is decided an
					hour before the actual tour starts depending on the prediction from
					the met department and experienced lads.</p>
				<p>Finally there was a go ahead plan and I was picked up around
					8 PM. Reach to the destination was around 10.30 PM.Northern lights
					come to limelight only around midnight/late night after it gets
					bright darker.The tour was comprised of 50 people travelling in a
					bus with high hopes and dreams.</p>
				<p>We reached the spot around 10.30 PM and jumped onto the land
					for the impatient wait.It was hell cold outside and everyone was
					freezing.The guide was an experienced female and assured that we
					would be witnessing it.The stream was very thing and never became
					strong.We kept waiting for almost an hour before the gang headed
					back to the bus not withstanding the freezing temperature.</p>
				<p>However , myself ,couple from America and the guide made up
					our mind to stay outside.We surmounted the cold to witness the
					stream finally gaining momentum.At a point we saw a meteor kind of
					thing the sky flashing and travelling at lighting speed.We really
					did not know what it was.</p>
				<p>After sometime the stream grew more and more and we saw
					multiple shades of beauty in the sky.We started screaming inviting
					the ones waiting inside the bus.Finally , there arrived the moment
					when the lady aurora started dancing by travelling from one end to
					another.It was like a dream and we could not believe what we were
					witnessing.Our emotions were at peak at this moment.However , it
					was a shame that I missed capturing it in the camera since I did
					not own a tripod.</p>
