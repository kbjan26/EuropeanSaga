				<p>Reykjavik , capital of Iceland is a tiny little place and
					there are some beautiful spots to cover.Main attractions are
					Cathedral,Harbor,Museum and tiny art galleries.</p>
				<p>The stretch around the harbour lake is flcoked by tourists
					and early morning joggers.This was located right opposite to my
					hostel and I started my day with walk along the harbor lake.It
					gives you some stunning views.Located near by the harbor is the
					Reykjavik art gallery.The admission ticket was around 1500 ISK and
					it includes free entry to other 2 art galleries located in the
					city.If you are an art lover you would not be disappointed with the
					things available for display.After sending quite some time here ,I
					headed for the cathedral which is the most popular attraction in
					the city.</p>

					offereing.It has lots and lots of restro bars selling drinks at
					high price.For Asians, there is Nepalese,Thai and Pakistani
					restaurant.Be aware of the prices of the products in the high
					street here.They are usually higher that what you expect.In case if
					you are looking for a decent and cheap super market ,then there is
					one called BONUS.</p>
