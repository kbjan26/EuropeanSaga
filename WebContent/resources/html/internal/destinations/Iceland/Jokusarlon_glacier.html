				<p>Day trip to Jokusarlon glacier is probably the longest day
					trips of all.Its is located in the South eastern corner and is
					almost 400 Kms away.We started around 7 AM in the morning and what
					was in store were magnificient landscapes.</p>
				<p>Enroute to this beauty includes stop at Vik village,Skogafoss
					waterfall,black sand beach.</p>
				<p>The guide was pretty experienced and briefed us on the rich
					Icelandic history.The population of whole Iceland is not even more
					than half a million.The enroute spots included farms where home
					grown agro products were briefed about.We were also shown schools
					in remote places where education style was completely different
					from the contemporary world.</p>
				<p>After a brief journey , we stopped at black sand beach which
					was literally filled with black pebbles and surrounded by black
					hills due to high volcanic activity in the past.It was truly an
					amazing spot to visit.Then , we headed to a nearby village called
					Vik for lunch and refreshment.The tiny village we were told has
					less than 300 inhabitants.</p>

				<p>Post noon travel was to the actual destination,
					Jokusarlon.Its the largest glacier lake in Iceland.After almost 5
					hours of travel we finally reached.The view of the large ice cakes
					were stunning and we could see large group of seals which is a
					primary inhabitant in this region.It also started raining by the
					time we reached this spot and hence could not spend much time
					outside.There is also a cafe in this region supplying refreshments.</p>
				<p>On our return fortunately the sun started shining and the
					enroute stop was at skogafoss waterfalls.Skogafoss is one of the
					largeest waterfalls in Iceland which gives you a stunning view from
					the roads.We had almost an hour.This place was already covered in
					my itineray as part of Solheimajokull hike.However,it was sunny
					this time around</p>
				<p>In order to compensate for the rainfall we had at sunshine
					which had just over taken the rainfall. We were welcomed with a
					bright ray of rainbow which fell over the waterfall.Gradually this
					thine ray doubled to showcase what the nature had in reserves.No
					wonder why nature is supreme.I had some of the best shots captured
					at this place.</p>

					<p>Always carry umbrella and coat whenever you are in Iceland.</p>
