				<p>Be prepared for a busy schedule if you are to cover both Hall
					stat and Dachstein glacier and further scaling up to see the five
					finger spot.I had booked a train from Vienna to Hall stat which had
					transit at Attnang-Puchheim Bahnhof. I had pre booked my tickets
					through OBB website</p>
				<a href="http://www.oebb.at/en/" target="_blank">OBB website </a>
				<p>The journey from the HallStatt station to the town is through
					the ferry service. One way fare costs 2.60 Euros and is one of the
					rides that I have ever taken. It gives you a stunning and
					fantabulous view of the entire from the other end.The town is so
					small and an overnight stay here no doubt would have been so
					pleasant which I missed it unfortunately due to lack of planning. I
					had my accomodation in Lake fuschl area.

				<p>After roaming around for a while headed to the bus station
					which takes the tourists to Obertraun from where you get the cable
					car to scale up to Dachstein glacier spot and five finger
					point.Please be aware of the bus timings since you have only one
					bus every hour.Also near the bus station is the tourist office
					where you can gather all required information about the place and
					park your luggage for few Euros if need be which I did since I was
					carrying a huge baggage.</p>

				<p>Both the glacier and the five fingers can be covered only if
					you are at the place very early.The last bus back from Obertraun to
					HallStat is around 16.40 PM and hence you must in a position to
					have covered both the places before that.</p>
				<p>Both Dachstein glacier and five finger point has to be
					covered by taking cable car.Whole package costs you 41.10 Euros for
					adults.Dachstein glacier is the first stop using cable car and
					further scaling up takes you the point where you can reach to five
					finger point by 20 minute walk.</p>
				<p>Visit to the Dachstein cave is a guided tour where the guide
					briefs the crowd in both German and English.The entire walk inside
					the ice cave lasts for almost 30 mins and the temperature inside is
					freezing cold.You are taken through the entire stretch and brief
					the history ,science behind the formation of the glacier.Ensure you
					carry a coat since it will be freezing cold inside.After completing
					the glacier walk headed back to the spot to scale further up using
					the cable to the viewing point.</p>

					<p>Ensure you arrive in HallStatt very early to cover both

					<p>Avoid the ferry ride in Hallstat in case if you are
						travelling from station through boat service.It substitues for the
						ferry ride and is going to be a redundan one.</p>
					<p>Take winter jacket in case if you are doing glaceier walk.</p>
					<p>You have facilities to place your luggage in HallStatt
						tourist until 5 PM.</p>
