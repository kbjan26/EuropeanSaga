				<p>Both Mondsee and St.Wolfgangsee are beautiful lake districts
					in Salzkammgerut region</p>
				<p>Where ever you are , you need to come to St.Gilgen to go to
					Mondsee and Wolfgangsee. The former can be reached by bus easily
					and for the latter it is better to take a direct ferry from
					St.Gilgen.Watch out for the ferry timings when you are in
					Wolfgangsee.It takes half an hour by boat from St.Gilgen. You can
					see beautiful green spots in the water due to the presence of
					limestones underneath the surface of the water.</p>
				<p>Mondsee is a very tiny lake district with ancient church,park
					and a lake where you can take boat ride.The boat ride gives you a
					panaromic view of the lake.</p>
				<p>The main activity in the Wolfgangsee region is the Cogwheel
					ride up to the top which runs by Coal.It takes you back to the
					ancient days the railways operated and the again the view enroute
					are simply spectacular.The cost of the ride is 41.10 and the
					journey to the top takes approximately 30 minutes.You have a
					restaurant at the top to refresh and reenergize.After reaching the
					top you can do hiking in several directions climbing down and up
					again.Ensure you reach the place pretty early to experience all
					this.</p>
