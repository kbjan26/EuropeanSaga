				<p>Landed around 9.30 AM in the morning of August10th in split.
					Had planned for cetina rafting afternoon at 13.30 and was heading
					on a tight schedule. To my dismay at the luggage belt counter was
					around 45mins making it more impatient. I then headed out to see
					buses for split and was able to catch the one about to leave. I had
					to stand through out. The climate was hot and the traffic on the
					roads was pathetic. Split does not have metro facilities unlike
					other cities in Europe. It was feel at home experience since I am
					from India. Finally reached split around 11.15 and headed to hostel
					by taxi. I didn't want to risk my time finding the route myself. I
					was charged 60 kunas for just fee mins of drive.</p>

				<p>I did a checkin and completed my brunch that I had prepared.
					Had to come to the bus station again to catch bus to omis. The bus
					was 60 and had started from thee station waiting neat the signal. I
					ran all the way to request the driver to open the door and he
					kindly obliged. Again the journey was hell taking one hour and
					fifteen mins. Finally reached around 13.10 and sharp at 1.30 Mate
					came to pick us up. We were picked up at studenac shopping centre.
					We went all the way up in car to the starting point. We were told
					the entire journey is 12kms and it would take three hours.It indeed
					took almost 3 hours to complete including pit stops taken.</p>

				<p>We were dressed up and started around 14.30. Guide name was
					karlos, a young energetic enthusiastic guy. I teamed up with a
					family from hungray and we were 7on the whole. Enroute was pretty
					interesting covering rough paths. Midway we got down at a point to
					go through a small cave where the temperature was freezing. Though
					the time spent inside was few mins the experience was amazing with
					fresh drinking water coming from the branches of the trees. After
					covering certain distance we parked at a small cliff where everyone
					was allowed to jump. There was dedicated guide who was travelling
					in a separate boat to capture the entire journey of us and we were
					charged 230 kunas plus 100 for the photos.</p>
