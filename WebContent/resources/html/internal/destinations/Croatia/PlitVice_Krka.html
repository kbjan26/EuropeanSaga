				<p>Started to PlitVice by taking early morning bus at 7 from
					Split and reached at 10.30 A.M.It was drizzling and cloudy when I
					landed.PlitVice lakes consists of close to 100 tiny waterfalls
					dropping out from tiny cliffs across the stretch of the
					landscape.They are treat to watch.If you take any of the routes you
					will see waterfalls of different sizes through out giving stunning
					views.The place is unharmed not invaded and clean. The climate was
					cloudy which made our walk easy.Ensure you carry food and water
					along to help you to re-energize yourself.</p>

				<p>Krka was allocated was for day 4 and prior bookings were done
					using getbybus.com. Departure was at 7 and return was around
					19.30.Another hectic day ahead was I thought.on the contrary krka
					is one of the best places for relaxation. From the entrance you are
					taken by the boat to the national park and it's close to 30 mins
					journey. The large waterfall is beautiful and you are allowed to
					take a dip there.</p>
				<p>The entries path around it is 2Km and you can complete in
					less than an hour since I completed it early I decided to scale up
					further to visit two islands by boat. The overall journey is 4
					hours including the transit but it gives you a highly relaxing
					sensation. I had my kindle and was just reading taking enough rest.
					The total price was 280 kuna.</p>

				<p>The entire day was so peaceful apart from two unforgettable
					incidents I had lost my entrance ticket before entering the park.
					(this is something that I am always good at). I told them I lost it
					during boat journey. They were kind enough to allow me inside
					believing I bought a ticket on my return I decided to depart early
					around 6.30 and made it on time for the bus. But before I could
					grab a seat I realised I had forgotten the camera.</p>
				<p>It was shit feeling and had to board off. It was quite a few
					minutes on my way back to the park entrance thinking where I lost
					finally I arrived in the reception and told them I had lost my
					camera. Fortunately someone had given it and they were holding it.
					They told it was found in the park. The incident left me an
					unforgettable mark on this place</p>
