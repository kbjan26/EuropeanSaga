				<p>I was supposed to do blue caves myself by making it to vis
					island but unfortunately the weather was not supposed and the tour
					was cancelled. However I had alternate plans of HVAR or BRAC and
					finally chose HVAR. The choice was never a disappointment and HVAR
					is such a a beautiful place to spend. Did a day trip from split by
					taking jadrolinija catamaran.</p>
				<p>Took a 9.45 one and reached around 11. The first place that
					everyone visits is the castle standing a tall a proficient landmark
					in the tiny island. The walk is just 15mins to the top and the view
					is majestic. You get panaromic view of the island from the top. A
					drink in the sun sitting there getting an aerial view is soothing
					and relaxing. The second half of the trip was towards a secluded
					island near HVAR.</p>
				<p>There are two islands out of which you can choose to spend. I
					chose less crowded one and the to and fro journey is just
					40kunas.people go there just to relax and swim in the less rough
					seas. I spent one and half hour in the water. It's soo cool to swim
					in the sea at ease with sea remaining calm throughout the day.The
					beach here was a nude one with most of people stripped off clothes
					and were relazing under the sun.</p>

				<p>Ensure you take a sandal to walk along the rocks. There is a
					restaurant in each of the island incase if you Don take your own
					food. I carried my lunch.</p>
				<p>I had an hour and half waiting time for our ferry and I was
					relaxing. When the time came I approached the boarding point and on
					my way met a couple again whom I met in the morning during my
					castle walk we were delighted and started interacting more on each
					one's whereabouts I was explaining my solo travels and they were so
					impressed. They also confessed that they have quit their jobs and
					have planned to travel the world as much as possible . They were
					from Aruba a Dutch colony in carribean island.</p>

				<p>I requested them for currency and coin of their country since
					I am a numismatist and currency collector. They gave me a currency
					and coin each for which I paid an equivalent exchange. I resisted
					to accept it as their gift since the value was quite high. The coin
					was square shaped and came to know the only country in the world to
					mint square coins. Another best memory of solo travelling.</p>

					<p>Jadrolinija catamaran or ferry options are plenty and you
						can purchase your ticket on the day.</p>
					<p>Ensure you go there atleast an hour before to check on the
						availability or you can reserver the ticket the day before.</p>
					<p>One of the seculded islands is completely nude and I
						realised only after I reached the place.</p>
					<p>The cost to and fro for the secluded islands is just 40 KUNA
						and is worth doing it.</p>
