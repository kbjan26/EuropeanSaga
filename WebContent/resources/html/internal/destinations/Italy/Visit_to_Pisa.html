				<p>Pisa was a supposed to be a short stop on my way to Naples
					from Venice.The main station is the Pisa centrale where you will
					have to get down. From there it is fifteen minutes by walk or 5
					minutes by Bus.The bus that goes from the station is lamo Rosa</p>
				<p>Though this is the primary attraction , it is not be
					missed.It will not take more than three hours to cover this place.</p>

				<p>I landed around 6 and was done by 8.30 P.M and was back at
					the train station.The more interesting part was reserved for the
					late half of the day.I was supposed to go to Naples and had booked
					an early morning train at 1.35 AM since it was quite
					cheaper.TrenItalia is the only service provider I have personally
					witnessed charging huge price for train journeys.I had booked my
					tickets prior for 9 Euros and just wanted to check how much they
					charge on the day and hence headed to KIOSK to check the prices.</p>

				<p>YES!!!! What you see in the picture is right and was taken
					aback to see the price rising 8 times.Never mess with TrenItalia
					and plan well ahead if you are thinking of using their service when
					you are in Italy.Now it was the time to spend my time all alone in
					the station till 1.35 AM.</p>
				<p>I was quite afraid of this and had posted several questions
					prior in Pisa forum in TripAdvisor.To my dismay , I did not receive
					any answer.There is nothing much outside the station apart from a
					Hotel and kebab shop.I was asking the patrolling Police as to how
					long they will be available and they told me that they will not be
					available after midnight.I was even checking with the passengers
					who were even waiting at the station and everyone was departing
					prior to me.This even increase the fear inside me. I was alone with
					Kindle at my disposal reading.But then, I was told by one of the
					lady Police who came for patrolling that the BAR near by the
					station runs throughout the day and I could stay there and enter
					the station few minutes before the arrival of the train.</p>
				<p>All of a sudden one of the lady passengers whom I enquired
					and who departed prior to me approached me before departing to
					point me to two girls who were sitting along side of a corner
					informing that they were waiting for the same train as mine.I was
					quite relieved now so that I did not have to go to the BAR
					nearby.They were from Korea and we stayed at the company of each
					other till the train arrived.Though I did not witness anything
					serious or bad , waiting all alone on a foreign land on solo
					travelling is quite a thrilling experience.</p>

					<p>Just be on the watch out and safe guard your
						belongings.Enquire with fellow travellers and that's how I came to
						know about my companions who were waiting for the same train.</p>
