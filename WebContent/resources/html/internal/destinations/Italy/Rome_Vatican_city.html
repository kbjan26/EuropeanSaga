				<p>Rome and Vatican city have some of the best ancient offerings
					that you will ever see.The former has much of ancient remains and
					the latter is related to the Catholic religious offerings.I had two
					days at my disposal with one day spent at each place.</p>
				<h5>Best way to roam Rome ?</h5>
				<p>When I landed there the first I did was purchasing 48 hour
					pass for 2 days.This includes unlimited use of metros,buses and
					entrance to Colosseum and historl town of Rome,entry to one of the
					castles in Rome.My accomodation was just five minute walk from Roma
					termini and it was much comfortable for me to leave the luggage on
					the last day to come and pick it up later.</p>
				<p>On my very first day visited Vatican museum,Sistine chapel
					and St peter's basilica.Vatican museum can easily take three to
					four hours to complete with so much at the display.It also has
					paint galleries to visit.</p>

					<h5>How to buy tickets for the Vatican museum ?</h5>
				</center>
				<p>Tickets can be either purchased directly at the counter or
					online.Pre book the tickets online through the below website.The
					full price ticket along with audio guide is 23 euros.</p>

				<p>The queue on any given will be too much that you will end
					wasting quite a lot of time.At the very end of the museum is the
					Sistine Chapel and heading further along you could easily enter St
					peter's basilica but you will have to upgrade your normal ticket
					for this.Else you could come out and walk few hundered meter's to
					get to the entrance of St Peter's Basilica</p>

				<p>Second day was allocated was colosseum and roma forum.Even
					with the pre-purchased roma pass the waiting time at the Colosseum
					can be anywhere between 45 mins to few hours.Reach the plac as
					early as possible.You can even opt for some of the guided tours to
					skip the line.Colosseum is one of the biggest amphi theatres that
					you will ever see and the history is so huge.The way it has been
					constructed ,it utilization is simply stunning.</p>

						<p>Colossuem - What is it?</p>
					</h5>
				</center>
				<p>The emperors of Rome built this large amphitheatre for
					gladiatorial shows and hunts of wild animals which became the
					symbol of the Eternal City. In 80 A.D. there was a magnificent
					inauguration with games that lasted one hundred days during which
					five thousand beasts were killed. The shows were free of charge and
					the seats were assigned according to the class of spectators. The
					Colosseum was built primarily to entertain the masses in brutal and
					barbaric games. Some were beast on beast combat to the death.
					Others were people fighting animals to the death, while the most
					popular was the human on human combat. Gladiators were slaves,
					often captured in war, that were trained in special schools to
					fight each other to the death. The gladiatorial games were over by
					the year 438 A.D. while the shows with hunts of wild beasts
					continued until 523.</p>
