				<p>Visit to the city that floats in water was a much awaited one
					and it did not disappoint me indeed.The ancient city in Europe has
					so much to offer and I had too little time to spend with only one
					and half days.Italy itinerary was included right after my La
					Tomatina day August 31st 2016.Took an early morning flight from
					Barcealona to Venice and reached around 8.45 AM.</p>
				<p>How to reach the city of Venice from San Marco airport ?</p>
				<p>The combination of bus no 5 and water boat number 2 takes you
					to the beautiful city of Venice. The overall cost is 14 euros if
					you buy the combi ticket inside the airport.Buy one from the
					tourist information counter.Bus station is just outside the airport
					and a easy one to spot.</p>

				<p>The bus to the venice bus station is almost half and hour and
					from there the boat journey is 40 mins to San Marco. I had booked a
					hostel just one stop away from San Marco. Another beautiful
					accommodation to have every stayed facing the water body right in
					front of the entrance.The name of the stop is Zitelle and hostel is
					Generator Venice.</p>
				<p>How to cover the city of Venice by Boat?</p>
				<p>The best way is to buy a 24 hour pass and it costs you 20
					Euros.It gives unlimited travel through Boat to anywhere inside the
					city.</p>
				<p>After refreshing I started my day to Burano and Murano.
					Burano is a small island 30 mins from Venice housing colorful
					building painted in different attractive colors. You are in for
					some of the best shots if you are good at photography. The entire
					place takes two to cover. Murano is a place where glass is
					manufactured and too many shops around selling home made glasses.</p>

				<p>Walk around Burano takes 2 to three hours and Murano is
					fairly small.</p>
				<p>Walking around San Marco square ,visiting Rialto
					Bridge,getting lost inside the streets of Venice are the some of
					best activities to do when you are there.Getting lost was the best
					thing to be trapped in the maze design the streets have been
					designed. You end starting and ending at the same place many times
					and you will feel like lost without map or the help of others.</p>

				<p>San Marco square is one of the biggest town sqaures that I
					have seen in Europe.The gigantic bell tower and Doge's palace, The
					Church add further beauty to it.</p>
				<p>Second day first half was intended to cover San Marco
					square.I chose to cover doges palace bascilica church and Bell
					tower. The Doge's palace covers the republican history of Venice
					and takes three hours to complete. The church is free of cost and
					takes less than half an hour. You can leave your luggage at the
					office near the church. The cost of bell tower is 9 euros.Entrance
					of Doge's palace is 20 euros and audio guide is 5 euros.</p>
