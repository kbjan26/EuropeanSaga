				<p>The most exaggerated and high price island near Naples is
					Capri.I had Capri as part of my itinerary mainly due to Blue Grotto
					or Blue Caves.I could not visit one in Vis Island , Split when I
					was there due to bad weather.Fortunatelty , when I was in Naples
					the weather was favourable.Another advantage of Capri blue caves is
					that it is operational till 5.30 unlike the one in Croatia where
					they close it by 1 or 2 PM.</p>
				<p>Started in 9.30 ferry from Municipo ( the station name the
					same if you travel in line M1). After reaching the island I book
					the full island tour that includes visit to Blue grotto for 18
					euros that doesn't include entrance cost of 13 euros.</p>

				<p>They island tour last for one hour and covers northern
					southern eastern and western parts showing you the best parts of
					the island. They start with place where a fisherman icon is place
					on top of the rock. Then they show you the arch shaped rocks the
					green caves light house peak points of the cliffs the caves the two
					big rocks and finally blue grotto. The waiting time to Blue grotto
					at the entrance can be painful if the crowd is huge. On the day I
					went it was almost two hours but all was worth the wait. You are
					shifted into a tiny rowing boat where no more than four people are
					seated.</p>

				<p>The guide asks you to sit deep inside since the opening to
					the caves is very very small. I met another solo traveller en route
					and we decided to capture photos of each other. The entry to the
					caves itself is quite breath taking and the color of the waters
					inside is simply stunning that you can never imagine as to how it
					would have looked from outside. You get only five to ten mins
					inside to stay but it's all the worth and it's one unique
					experience.</p>

						<p>The entrance to the caves is only 9 euros if you are there
							on the first Sunday of September every year.</p>
						<p>Ana Capri is another beautiful place to visit.</p>
						<p>Capri is super expensive and ensure you carry some snacks
							and food along when you plan to go to Capri.</p>
						<p>It is highly risky to enter Blue Grotto after working hours
							and it is highly dangerous that you can trapped inside leading to
							death.</p>
