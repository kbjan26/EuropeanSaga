						<p>How to reach Pompeii from Naples ?</p>
					</center>
				</h4>
				<p>Pompeii is just 30 mins from Naples and the train that goes
					to Sorrento stops at Pompeii Scavi.Go to Circumvesuviana station
					and take a direct train to Sorrento and get down at Pompeii
					scavi.The round trip train cost from Naples is 5.10 Euros.</p>

				<p>Right opposite to the train station location is the Pompeii
					Scavi.It is one of the well preserved excavation spots I believe
					and also the space that it covers is huge.The entrance fee to the
					site is 13 Euros and the audio guide is 5 euros separately.</p>
				<p>When you exit the station there is a tourist agency who
					provide guided tour for both Mount Vesuvis and ruins of Pompeii.I
					chose to do guided trip for Vesuvius since I was travelling
					alone.The roundtrip cost is 22 euros.Mount Vesuvis is supposed to
					be one of the most active volcanic spots in Europe and the eruption
					lead to the destruction of Pompeii in the past.You can still see
					some Sulphur gas coming out due to high temperature in the region.</p>
				<p>There are two bus that you take to reach Vesuvis. The first
					one travels along the hill and the next one travels along the most
					rugged path and can be too annoying.After you reach the spot , you
					will have to hike for 20 mins before you the actual mountain.You
					are given close to hour and half to hike around the place which
					gives some splendid views of Pompei and Amalfi Coast.</p>
				<p>It was evening when I scaled down and headed to Pompeii
					immediately.You need atleast three to four hours to see the ruins
					and excavation findings.</p>
