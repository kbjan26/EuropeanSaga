					<p>The only reason why I have visited Amsterdam twice is for
						this place.An earthly heaven I would call it.The journey started
						with entire day allocated.Located at 45 mins journey from
						Amsterdam central, Keukenof gardens,has both mad made and natural
						fields at its stake.</p>
					<p>Flowers here blossom between March end and lasts till mid of
						May every year.Both man made gardens and natural gardens are a
						huge crowd puller.Witnessing huge variety of tulips and cycling
						around the large natural gardens will leave you captivated.</p>
					<p>Ensure you allocate whole to be spent at kekuneof.Start your
						day early and ensure you are at the boarding point (in my case it
						was from Schipol airport.).There are two areas to view the
						abundance of the flowers - the man made gardens and the natural
						flower fields.Try to book tickets online which includes the
						transportation costs along with the entrance tickets.</p>
					<p>The man made gardens covers a huge area and take around 3
						hours.There are several varieties of Tulips planted and they are
						charm to witness.There are places to relax,energize,to dine inside
						the gardens.</p>

					<p>Once you are done with the gardens comes the next big thing
						, the natural flower fields.The fields have shades of flowes grown
						by the farmers and they blossom between March last week and lasts
						till mid of May which pulls crowd from all over the world.</p>
					<p>The natural flower fields are spread across several KMs.Near
						the entrance of the gardens , you can hire a cycle which will cost
						you around 12 euros to go the natural flower fields.There will be
						designated and signed paths to follow in order to reach there and
						the locals will be able to give you a better picture of the
						presence of flowers in each of those places.You have several shops
						enroute to stop by.</p>
