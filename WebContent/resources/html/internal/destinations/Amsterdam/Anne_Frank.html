					<p>The only museum of its kind which will always hold a special
						place in my heart. This was included in my itinerary as part of my
						visit along with my friend and was recommended by a person living
						in Amsterdam.</p>
					<p>We reached this place around 9.30 AM in the morning hoping
						to get the entry and exiting early so that we could continue our
						journey.To our dismay , we had to wait for almost four hours in
						the queue.This impatient waiting time made us read the pamplet
						that was served outside the house in multiple versions.We grabbed
						a english version and started reading through the content
						unwillingly.</p>
					<p>I was intrigued by the contents of the passage since I did
						not collect prior knowledge of the house.On a candid front , I
						must admit that to have really been moved upon reading and
						listening to the stories and suffering of this lady. She had
						survived with many of her familiy members concealded inside a room
						staying mum all during the day with little opportunity for much
						interaction during the night for survival during Hitler regime.</p>
					<p>The wait was really worth and visit to this place will have
						a definite hangover for atleast few mins after you come out.</p>
					<p>Heinieken beer factory has nothing much apart from the
						display as to how beer is made. Small demo of the entire life
						cycle is available inside the house with complementary beer served
						at the end.However , one this that will amaze is the brand value
						that it has got all over the globe and the place it has stamped in
						this arena.</p>
