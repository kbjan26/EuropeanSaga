				<p>This place requires a special mention in my page.Its one of
					the nicest hostels that I have ever stayed and ever will.The only
					hostel of all my stays where in house people were so
					informative.They have information at their finger tips.</p>
				<p>I am a budget traveller and try to cook in the accomodation
					where I stay.To my surprise , they have all spices and powders
					required to prepare an Indian dish.The staff were world class and
					keep the ambience lively all throughout the day.</p>
				<p>They also serve free paella,tapas,sagria on alternate days
					with games conducted inside during late evenings.They also conduct
					free walking tours around La Rambles.The cutleries are plentiful
					and also located is a super market located in the same building as
					hostel's.Free walking tour is conducted every day starting from Plac Catalunya.</p>
