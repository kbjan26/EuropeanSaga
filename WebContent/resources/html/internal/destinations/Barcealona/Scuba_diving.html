					<p>One of the most cherished and celebrated events was scuba
						diving in Spain.After I started taking solo travelling seriously,
						I chose Spain as one of the destinations.I have seen the best of
						Spain from an Indian movie Zindagi na Milegi Dobara.The movie
						revolves around friends celebrating their life through travelling
						Spain completely.All the major events are filmed in that move one
						of which is Scuba diving.I ensured to do it when I am in
						Barcealona.</p>
					<p>After doing enough research narrowed down on l'Estartit
						location in Costa Brava which are famous for diving schools.I
						chose a diving school which was offering photos as well for the
						overall price of 65 euros.Whole day was dedicated for this
						activity.</p>
					<p>I chose it to do on a Saturday.Distance was pretty long from
						Barcealona.I had to take a train to a city called Girona and then
						had to take a bus to l'Estartit. The only service provider in this
						is AMPA and their time lines are very specific are very fixed but
						very reliable.</p>
					<p>I had scheduled my diving at 10.30 AM.Started from
						Barcealona around 7.30 A.M by taking a train to Girona.After
						reaching Girona, the wait was around one hour for AMPA bus.It then
						started around 9 A.M and dropped me at 10 A.M.The guys from the
						diving school were waiting for me already for giving me a hell of
						an experience.</p>

					<p>Initial settlement was around the size of the outfit and
						trying out the oxygen masks.Also instructed was the moves to be
						done when I am inside the works and to look out for the guide's
						signla to free the ear blockage.After finalizing on the
						equipments,the ride from the shore was around 15 mins where we
						went few kms inside where there are points identified for scuba
						divers of different categories.The adrenaline was gradually
						building then.I had imagined so many things and being an able
						swimmer assumed it be a cake walk.But what was in store was
						something different.</p>
					<p>After reaching the spot,we started to suit ourselves with
						necessary outfits and equipments for the dive.Everything was
						normal until they added the oxygen cylinder and the weights around
						my waist.I felt so so heavy on top my weight and was asked to jump
						in to the water.</p>

					<p>I could not understand what was happening initially since
						everything was out of control.I was there floating like a dead
						body unable to move my body and get the control.Then with Kevin's
						help, I went inside the water and was asked to breathe
						comfortably.I was breathing with heavy panic and could not sustain
						inside for more than a minute.This happened couple of times and
						felt like giving up by heart.But,Kevin and team were highly
						motivating and initial 10 minutes they helped me relax and bring
						stability.</p>

					<p>Then,I started listening to the signals which had
						instructions clearly.After few meters inside , it was experience
						of a different feel seeing the wonder inside.We went 7 meters
						inside and the view was stunning.It was an unforgettable
						experience.I felt proud of doing it and one item was knoced off my
						bucket list finally.</p>
