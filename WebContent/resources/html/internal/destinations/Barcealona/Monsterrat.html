				<p>Monsterrat is one of the most soughted day trips from
					Barcealona.Did enough research around this place and chose this for
					its rich history.</p>
				<p>Day 3 was exclusively allocated for this and the day ahead
					was very long.The whole cost of making it to the monastery is 29
					euros.The cost includes 2 metro rides(you can use it to start from
					your accomodation and to return),train from Espanya to
					Monsterrat,cable car and funicular trains.</p>
				<p>This website has every detailed information that will help
					you plan day trip to Monsterrat in an efficient way.</p>
				<p>Jouney from Espanya is around an hour after which you reach
					this splendid beauty.Its located at hill top and the jouney to the
					top can be taken either using a train or cable car.I chose a cable
					car.The enroute experience and view using the cable car is simply
					breathtaking.Ensure you allocate whole day for this place since
					there are many TODO things.Monk's choir and further scaling top
					using funicular trains are must done things when you are in
					Monsterrat.</p>
				<p>I stared my journey by visiting the museum which depicts the
					birthplace and the religious happenings.You will be taken away by
					the reason as to why this place considered to be sacred and also
					the dail routine of the monks living here who strive to hold the
					religious belief to the upcoming generations.</p>
				<p>I roamed around the hill top to get some of the splendid
					views.The place also sells some of the best local cheese made of
					goat and cow milk.They are yummy and delicious.After couple of
					hours walk , sat to have my own lunch prepared by myself.</p>
				<p>Also included in my itinerary was journey to further top
					using funicular trains.You never know a big hike is awaiting until
					you reach further top and the very reason why I allocated my entire
					day here.When you hike further you get some of the most amazing
					views and place to relax.</p>
				<p>Once everything was done , I came to the monastery to witness
					boy's black choir as it is famously called. Its held twice a day ,
					one at 12 PM noon and 6.45 in the evening.I missed the morning one
					and hence ensured I see it the evening before I leave.Its all
					together a different experience to small boys of the monastery and
					experienced monks come together to render their religious verses.</p>

					<p>Buy the round trip ticket from the tourist counter before
						the day. The ticket comes with free metro rides that you can make
						use of instead of using your T10 ride or buying a separate ticket.</p>
					<p>Black choir is performed by child monks and senior monks in
						the monastery twice a day.The singing takes place in the Basilica
						of Montserrat. One at 12.00 PM and another at 18.45 PM.</p>
