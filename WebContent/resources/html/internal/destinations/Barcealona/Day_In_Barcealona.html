				<p>Berlin SXF airport has been my transit point for most of
					European destinations.Had a overnight lay in the airport since my
					flight was around 6.30 A.M.Reached Barcealona around 9 A.M.Realised
					the place is similar to Poland with many prefer speaking their own
					language after my struggle in buying train ticket.</p>
				<p>Took renfe train from the airport and reached Plac Catalunya
					around 10.30.I had pre booked for one of the top attractions in the
					city , Sagrada Familia. The cost of the ticket is 29 euros and my
					slot was at 12.45 at the entrance and at 14.30 for one of the
					towers.I also ensure I booked my accomodation in city centre and
					locked in on Hostel 360 Barcealona.Sagrada Familia was just 20 mins
					walk from this place.</p>
				<p>Constructions and main attractions inside the city are
					reflections of Gaudi's artistic plenitude.The same hangover is felt
					across the city where he has left us with his masterpieces that
					includes Casa Mila,Casa Batlo and Park Guel.</p>
				<p>When I was there, April 2016 , there was construction still
					in progress at the top.For 29 euros you get audio guide,entrance to
					the church itself and tower top.Its better to book online in order
					to avoid long queues.</p>
				<p>The architecture of this giant is simply stunnig and you will
					feel it even better when you are inside and witness the light rays
					that enter the building.Its amazing how he has visualised and
					constructed this beauty.</p>

				<p>After visiting the the three main houses , headed to park
					guell by taking bus 24 from the city.The place is quite and I had
					prebooked my slot for 4 PM.Right from the entrance to the pavillion
					you find nuances of Gaudi's excellence.The place also has the Gaudi
					house Museum which was Gaudi's residence for almost twenty years.</p>
				<p>I had reserved my late second half other day for La
					Rambles.After reading through many theories online , I perceived
					this place as one of the most unsafe areas to travel due to pick
					pocketting and petty crimes.</p>
				<p>All my prejudice were shattered when I started roaming
					through the market and main street.This is one of the place with
					rich ancient history.It is also the place where you get traditional
					Catalunya food.Roamed and walked through the streets extensively
					before clocking in on one of the restaurants in the Market Square.
					It was the only place which was serving vegetarain version of
					payella and tapas.</p>
				<p>One is not supposed to miss paella,tapas and Sagria which are
					traditional foods of Catalunya culture.They are delicious in deed.</p>
