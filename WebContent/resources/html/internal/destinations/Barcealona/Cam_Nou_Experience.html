				<p>What more can you ask for when you are in Barcealona.I was
					fortunate enough that I was able to witness a live Barca match. Yes
					, that right ,I watched them playing in Camp Nou stadium against
					Sporting Gijon.As part of trip research and travel planning
					realised there is a la liga match happening.Without any second
					thoughts booked a ticket and ensure I witness and feel the
					electrifying ,exuberance atmosphere.</p>
				<p>It was a double dhamaka for me because , there were two
					events parts of the same day - Scuba diving at Costa Brava in the
					morning and late evening live match at Camp Nou.</p>
				<p>I ensured I reach the place two and half hours before the
					game begins so that I see the building momentum in the ground.It
					was almost a sold house.There are many tourists like me ensure they
					do not miss on a live match when they are in Barcealona.Its a once
					in lifetime expereince for many including me.</p>

				<p>Most of the fans get drunk enough before the match in the
					bars outside so that they are energized. There are many stalls
					available which sell accessories outside at a pretty decent price.I
					bought myself a scarf with the club name embedded in it for 10
					euros.</p>

				<p>Seats near the goal posts seem to be occupied by hardcore
					club fans and frequent visitors.They were carrying the momentum
					through out the match.It was like a dream witnessing
					Messi,Suarez,Neymar,Piquie and the rest playing.Barcealona cake
					walked through scoring 7-0.Experience of a lifetime indeed.</p>

					<p>I had booked the ticket online way ahead for 85 euros.But to
						my surprise , the ticket was available inside the city shops even
						on the day of the match at 60 euros.If you are ready to take this
						risk avoid booking online and buy the tickets when you are in the
						city.</p>
