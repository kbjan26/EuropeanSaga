					<p>La Tomatina - the most cherished,most celebrated,most
						awaited of all my solo saga.Probably the only event I was waiting
						for so much time and planned several months prior and the one I
						did not want to miss.</p>
					<p>Tomatina is a traditional world famous festival where people
						gather from all around the globe to meet to have the experience
						and fun of throwing tomatoes at each other. It is celebrated on
						the last Wednesday of August every year in the town of Bunol near
						Valencia Spain. The event happens between 11AM and 12PM leaving
						spell bounded and amazed in the end. I was hoping for a good fun
						but never knew lifetime experience was on cards.</p>

					</p>
					<p>La Tomatina or the tomato festival is a Spanish festivity
						celebrated in the town of Bunyol, Region of Valencia at the end of
						August, typically the last Wednesday of the month. The origin of
						the tradition of La Tomatina dates back to August 1945. During the
						Giants and Big-Heads figures parade taking place at the town
						square several young people from the crowd wanted to take part in
						the parade, in spite of the objection displayed by the
						participants. This turn of events caused disorder, resulting in
						one of the participants getting knocked down, who in a fit of rage
						went to the nearest stall -which happened to be a market stall of
						fruit and vegetables- and grabbed some tomatoes. And thus chaos
						ensued, with the entire crowd throwing tomatoes at each other,
						until the local law enforcement intervened in this battle of
						vegetables and put an end to it.</p>
					<p>One year later, on the same day, the local young people
						tried to improvise a tomato throwing festival by starting a
						quarrel themselves, except this time they brought their own
						tomatoes from home. This went on for several years, gaining
						considerable popularity and becoming a tradition of sorts.
						However, during the 1950s, La Tomatina was temporarily banned,
						which of course didn't stop the tomato festival from happening,
						resulting in many young people getting imprisoned. La Tomatina
						became an official festivity in 1957.</p>

					<p>I chose to do a guided day trip from Barcelona. After
						searching online through various operators finally decided to go
						with tomatino.es. They were offering at 80 euros on the whole. The
						package includes bus transportation to and from Hard Rock Cafe,
						plac catalunya, t-shirt for the event and entry ticket. Pick up
						time is 2.30AM on the day of the event.</p>

					<p>After quite a delay, started around 3AM and reached bunol
						around 8PM. You are made to gather as a group after which t-shirt
						and wrist band are issued to the participants. You can leave your
						luggage inside the bus and also you have lockers near the
						entrance.</p>
					<p>Once you cross the entrance, you are made to assemble in the
						permissible lanes. The crowd is too much that you cannot even move
						and you move along with push from all sides. Initially the
						localities watching the event from the house secured pour water
						and throw small tomatoes to energize crowd.</p>
					<p>The atmosphere and momentum gets huge that you start going
						crazy. Then the giant trucks March towards the crowds and from
						then on events rolling out are unstoppable and unimaginable. Kudos
						to the organiser taking utmost safety and precautions for the
						event. Enough volunteers regulate the gathering when trucks start
						coming in.</p>
					<p>Initially my thought were that we will be given a glimpse of
						tomato throwing and will be made return back. To my amusement it
						was not the case and there were 4 huge trucks that followed one
						after the other leaving the place heavily flooded. The crowds go
						crazy and start smashing pouring tomatoes at each other leaving
						you drenched and wet completely. You do not have time to even
						think what's going around and plethora of happiness are on cards.</p>
					<p>Ensure you take enough photos during the event so that the
						memories are captured for lifetime. Tiny little town offers fun to
						thousands of people in a short span of time.</p>
