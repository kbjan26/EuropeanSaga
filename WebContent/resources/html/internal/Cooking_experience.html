				<p>Cooking is something that I have cultivated recently out of own
					interest and I am real proud of it.Since Indian by Nationality I am
					used to spicy food since childhood.Being a vegeterian I have found
					it hard and difficult to digest fries and salads all the time.But
					what triggered me cooking during my travels was completely
					different.</p>

					<figcaption class="caption wp-caption-text">I bought
						the sandwich and soup in Iceland on the first day trip to Golden
						circle waterfalls and it cost me whopping 30 euros.Then I decided
						that it would not make sense to eat all my meals outside.The same
						day I bought lunch containers and started cooking in hostel.Ever
						since then whereever I go I carry basic spices,container and small
						quantity of rice.I have also realised that I cannot be eating
						outside forever because at some point of time my taste buds yearn
						for spicy Indian flavour.</figcaption>

				<h3>What did I do to rescue myself and how one can manage ?</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Carry a lunch box container.</li>
					<li>Carry basic spices and rice (one can even include some
						dhal) or you can be thankful to many of supermarkets in Europe who
						sell India spices in tiny containers.</li>
					<li>My list includes curry,jeera,turmeric and some home made
						masala powder.You can also carry some whole tamarind.</li>
					<li>Ensure hostel of choice has kitchenette facilities(I even
						call and get this confirmed at times.)</li>
					<li>Buy basic groceries of your choice that are required to
						prepare the dish.</li>
					<li>Ensure I make some nice Indian sambhar/curry so that one
						meal has Indian food.</li>
					<li>This is a huge cost saver as well.</li>
					<li>Have patience and sacrifice some sleep to get up early and
						prepare food.</li>
